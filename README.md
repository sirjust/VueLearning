This repo follows the 10 video tutorial located here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoU-r7Hleog&list=PL1TrjkMQ8UbUb6enU-ESsbngYBLbE_sG4

Of note: I watched the videos while taking notes, then came back the following day and tried to recreate the examples using my notes.

This was in an effort to retain more information.

It was then immediately clear what concepts I didn't fully grasp
